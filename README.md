# a lil about me
**i love to make  software that just works.**
Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer and Unity developer with a passion for building software thatâ€™s reliable, scalable, and fun to use.

- On the web side, I work across the stackâ€”designing APIs, optimizing backends, and crafting smooth front-end experiences.
- On the game dev side, I create immersive projects in Unity, from Augmented Reality experiences (AR Foundation) to location-based games powered by Mapbox.
- Iâ€™m currently developing a high-performance matchmaking engine using Go and Ruby on Rails.

My pinned repositories showcase a mix of original projects and useful forksâ€”for example, integrating Unity games into React Native apps built with Expo.
